## The Problem

![Dark Talent](slide_problem.png)

The best trading ideas don't only come from Wall Street. Talented traders in developing countries have elite potential but lack the capital and connections to act on their ideas. OpenQuant exists to change that.

## The Solution

![Solution](slide_solution.png)

1. **Submit your pitch** — describe your trade idea, upload your strategy and any supporting data.
2. **Eva evaluates it** — our AI checks your data, your methodology, and runs a backtest automatically.
3. **We fund it** — if Eva gives it the green light, we allocate real capital and execute the trade.

## How Eva Works

![Eva Agent Swarm](slide_agents.png)

Eva is an AI system made up of 5 specialist agents that run simultaneously:

- **Clarifier** — understands and structures your pitch from plain English.
- **Data Provenance** — verifies your data actually came from the sources you claim.
- **Backtest** — runs your strategy against real historical prices to test performance.
- **Fabrication Detector** — spots fake or manipulated results.
- **Methodology Auditor** — checks for common errors like peeking at future data.

## Submitting a Pitch

1. Open the app and start a chat — Eva will guide you through everything.
2. Describe your trade idea in plain English (your thesis, how long you'd hold, which stocks).
3. Upload your strategy file (`.py` or `.ipynb` notebook) and any data files you're using.
4. Eva runs all checks automatically and gives you a score, report, and funding recommendation.

**That's it.** No special commands needed — just chat naturally.
