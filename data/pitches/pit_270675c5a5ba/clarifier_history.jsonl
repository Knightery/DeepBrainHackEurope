{"timestamp_utc": "2026-02-21T23:32:33Z", "role": "assistant", "content": "I've reviewed the first few cells of `algo-backend.ipynb`. It appears to be a tutorial on a **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** strategy using `nsepy` (National Stock Exchange of India data).\n\nThe previous input was parsed incorrectly as tickers. I need to clean that up and get the specifics.\n\n**Clarification Questions:**\n1. **Thesis & Edge:** The notebook mentions momentum is \"mean-reverting.\" Are you pitching a standard trend-following SMA strategy, or a mean-reversion strategy? What is your specific edge or modification to this standard approach?\n2. **Tickers:** Which specific stock tickers are you targeting? (The previous list was just words from your sentence).\n3. **Time Horizon:** Is \"weeks\" the correct holding period for this strategy?\n4. **Data:** Since the script uses `nsepy`, does it pull live data, or do you have specific historical data files to upload?\n\n**Current Checklist:**\n- [ ] **Thesis:** Needs detail (currently generic SMA).\n- [x] **Time Horizon:** Weeks (pending confirmation).\n- [ ] **Tickers:** Needs input.\n- [x] **Strategy File:** `algo-backend.ipynb` uploaded.\n- [ ] **Source URLs:** Not required yet (no data files uploaded).\n\nPlease clarify the thesis and tickers so we can proceed."}
