Please confirm if these details are correct:\n\n**1. Investment Thesis**\n\"Yield curve inversions (10Y < 2Y) historically precede recessions. Combining a yield curve regime filter with a 200-day price trend filter reduces downside exposure while capturing upside during expansions.\"\n\n**2. Tickers**\n`[\"SPY\"]`\n\n**3. Data Source**\nFRED (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) for the 10Y-2Y spread.\nURL: `https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=T10Y2Y`\n\n**4. Time Horizon**\nYour current setting is \"days\", but a 200-day moving average strategy typically implies a **\"years\"** or **\"months\"** horizon. Shall we update this to \"years\"?\n\n**5. Implementation Question**\nYour script is currently coded to download data directly from FRED (`requests.get`). Since you uploaded `T10Y2Y_spread.csv`, do you intend for the strategy to read this local file instead, or is it just for validation?\n\nI am running a validation check on your uploaded CSV now."}
