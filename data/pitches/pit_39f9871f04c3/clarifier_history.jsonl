Here is what I have:\n\n*   **Thesis**: Use the 10Y-2Y yield curve inversion and a 200-day moving average trend filter on SPY to reduce equity exposure during recessionary drawdowns.\n*   **Ticker**: SPY\n*   **Source**: FRED (St. Louis Fed)\n*   **Time Horizon**: Days (Daily checks)\n\n**Implementation Check**:\nYour script `yield_curve_momentum.py` is currently set up to **download data live** (lines 51 and 67). This often fails in reproducible testing environments.\n1.  Should we modify the script to read your uploaded `T10Y2Y_spread.csv` instead of calling the FRED API?\n2.  Do you plan to upload a CSV for SPY prices, or are you relying on the `yfinance` download working? (Uploading a static file is safer).\n\nI am queuing a validation check for your uploaded FRED data."}
