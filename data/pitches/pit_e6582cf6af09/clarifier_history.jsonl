{"timestamp_utc": "2026-02-21T23:59:54Z", "role": "assistant", "content": "I've reviewed the first few cells of `mean_reversion.ipynb`. It appears to be a mean reversion framework set up for **SPY** using daily data.\n\nTo move forward, I need to clarify the core logic and parameters:\n\n1.  **Thesis**: What is the specific signal? (e.g., \"Buy when price is 2 standard deviations below the 20-day moving average, sell at the mean.\")\n2.  **Tickers**: Is **SPY** the only target, or is this a basket strategy?\n3.  **Time Horizon**: The system defaults to \"weeks\", but mean reversion is often shorter (days). Which fits better?\n4.  **Data**: Your script attempts to download data via API. Do you have a local CSV to upload, or should we assume standard daily OHLCV data for the backtest?\n\n**Current Checklist:**\n- [ ] Thesis (Logic defined)\n- [?] Time Horizon: **Weeks** (Needs confirmation)\n- [?] Tickers: **SPY**?\n- [x] Strategy File: `mean_reversion.ipynb`\n- [ ] Supporting Data Files (if needed)\n\nPlease clarify the logic and confirm the ticker/horizon."}

I will trigger the backtest now using standard daily data for SPY."}
