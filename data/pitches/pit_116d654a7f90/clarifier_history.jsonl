{"timestamp_utc": "2026-02-22T08:35:34Z", "role": "assistant", "content": "I've analyzed your files. `yield_curve_momentum.py` provides a clear strategy structure, and `T10Y2Y_spread.csv` appears to be the supporting macro data.\n\nHere is the investment thesis and configuration I've extracted. Please confirm if this is accurate:\n\n**Investment Thesis:**\nA macro-regime strategy that holds **SPY** (S&P 500) only when it is above its 200-day moving average AND the 10Y-2Y Treasury yield spread is not inverted (above -0.10%), aiming to avoid major drawdowns associated with recessions.\n\n**Configuration:**\n- **Tickers:** `[\"SPY\"]`\n- **Time Horizon:** I've updated this to **Years** (from \"Days\") given the macro nature of the yield curve signal (6\u201318 month lead time).\n- **Data Source:** FRED (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis).\n\n**Critical Implementation Note:**\nYour script (`line 67`) currently attempts to download data directly from FRED (`requests.get`). Since you uploaded `T10Y2Y_spread.csv`, **should the script be updated to read this local file instead?** Relying on live web requests during backtesting can cause failures if the API is down or the environment lacks internet access.\n\nI am triggering a data validation check on your CSV now."}
