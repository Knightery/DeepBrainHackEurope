It contains a clear thesis and strategy definition.\n\n**Extracted Pitch Details:**\n*   **Thesis:** Avoid equities (SPY) when the 10Y-2Y yield spread is inverted (< -0.10%) and price is below the 200-day SMA to reduce drawdowns while retaining upside.\n*   **Ticker:** SPY\n*   **Time Horizon:** Days (Daily trend/regime filter)\n*   **Source URL:** `https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=T10Y2Y`\n\n**Observation:**\nYou uploaded `T10Y2Y_spread.csv`, but your script is currently coded to download this data directly from FRED (`requests.get`).\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1.  I will validate the uploaded CSV against the source URL to ensure data quality.\n2.  **Question:** Do you want the pipeline to use your uploaded CSV for the backtest (requires script modification), or should we stick to the live download in the script?"}
