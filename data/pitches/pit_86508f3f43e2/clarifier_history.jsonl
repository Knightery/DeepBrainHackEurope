{"timestamp_utc": "2026-02-22T08:58:14Z", "role": "assistant", "content": "I've analyzed the first few cells of `mean_reversion.ipynb`. It appears to be a **Mean Reversion** strategy targeting **SPY** using daily adjusted data.\n\nI have updated your ticker list to **SPY** and set the time horizon to **Days**.\n\n**Critical Gaps to Address:**\n1.  **Missing Data File**: Your script (Cell 7) attempts to read `../data/Stocks/spy.csv`. You have not uploaded this file. Please upload `spy.csv` or adjust the script to download data dynamically (as seen in the commented-out Cell 3).\n2.  **Thesis Specifics**: \"Mean Reversion\" is broad. What is the specific trigger? (e.g., \"Long when price is 2 standard deviations below the 20-day MA, exit at the mean\").\n\n**Current Checklist:**\n*   [~] **Thesis**: Mean Reversion on SPY (Needs specific entry/exit rules)\n*   [x] **Time Horizon**: Days\n*   [x] **Tickers**: [\"SPY\"]\n*   [x] **Strategy File**: mean_reversion.ipynb\n*   [ ] **Supporting Data**: Missing `spy.csv` (referenced in code)\n\nPlease upload the data file or clarify the data source, and define your exact entry/exit logic."}
