{"timestamp_utc": "2026-02-22T06:50:18Z", "role": "assistant", "content": "I've analyzed your uploaded script, `yield_curve_momentum.py`. It contains a clear strategy definition.\n\n**Extracted Pitch Details:**\n*   **Thesis:** Avoid equities during yield curve inversions (10Y < 2Y) to sidestep recessionary drawdowns, while using a 200-day SMA trend filter to capture upside during expansions.\n*   **Tickers:** [\"SPY\"]\n*   **Time Horizon:** Years (Macro/Trend following)\n*   **Data Source:** FRED (10Y-2Y Treasury Spread)\n\n**Next Steps:**\nI noticed you mentioned an `.ipynb` in your message, but the file processed was a `.py` script. I will proceed with the script.\n1.  **Data Validation:** I will check the `T10Y2Y_spread.csv` file you uploaded to ensure it's formatted correctly.\n2.  **Backtest:** I will attempt to run `yield_curve_momentum.py`.\n    *   *Note:* Your script is currently coded to download data from FRED directly. If the execution environment is restricted, it may need to be updated to read the local CSV instead. For now, I will run it as-is.\n\n**Current Checklist:**\n1.  [x] Thesis\n2.  [x] Time Horizon\n3.  [x] Tickers\n4.  [x] Strategy File (`yield_curve_momentum.py`)\n5.  [x] Source URLs\n6.  [x] Supporting Data (`T10Y2Y_spread.csv`)\n\nRunning validation and backtesting now."}
