{"timestamp_utc": "2026-02-22T01:13:53Z", "role": "user", "content": "this is my strategy, the thesis is The thesis is a two-signal regime filter for SPY:\n\nPrice momentum: Only hold equities when SPY is above its 200-day SMA (trend filter \u2014 stay out during downtrends).\nMacro regime (yield curve): Only hold equities when the 10Y-2Y Treasury spread (from FRED) is above -0.10% \u2014 i.e., avoid holding during deep yield-curve inversions.\nCore logic: A yield curve inversion (10Y < 2Y) historically precedes recessions by 6\u201318 months. By combining this inversion filter with the 200-day trend filter, the strategy aims to reduce equity exposure during the worst drawdown windows while keeping most of the upside during expansion phases.\n\nBoth signals must be true simultaneously to go long. Transaction costs of 0.05% per trade are applied."}

Please provide the **exact source URL** for the `T10Y2Y_spread.csv` file (e.g., the specific FRED page). I cannot validate the data without it.\n2. **Probing Question:** Macro data from FRED often has a publication lag (reporting vs. availability). Does your implementation in `yield_curve_momentum.py` account for this lag to prevent look-ahead bias, or does it trade on the timestamp of the data point itself?"}
