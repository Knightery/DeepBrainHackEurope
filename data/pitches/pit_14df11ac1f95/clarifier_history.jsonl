It provides a clear logic and structure.\n\n**Extracted Pitch Details:**\n*   **Thesis:** Reduce equity exposure (SPY) during recessionary periods by combining a yield curve inversion filter (10Y-2Y < -0.10%) with a 200-day moving average trend filter.\n*   **Ticker:** SPY\n*   **Time Horizon:** Years (implied by macro regime and 200-day trend).\n*   **Data Source:** FRED (T10Y2Y).\n\n**Probing Questions & Observations:**\n1.  **Data Lag & Look-Ahead Bias:** FRED interest rate data typically has a publication lag (e.g., data for day $T$ is released on $T+1$ or later). Your code uses `shift(1)` to trade. If the data isn't available at the market close of day $T$, this might introduce look-ahead bias. Have you verified the exact publication timing for this series?\n2.  **Reproducibility:** Your script currently attempts to download data via `requests.get`. For the final evaluation, it is safer to load the local `T10Y2Y_spread.csv` you uploaded. This prevents failures if the evaluation environment has restricted internet access.\n\nI am triggering a data validation on your CSV and an initial backtest on the script to see how it performs."}
