{"timestamp_utc": "2026-02-22T08:46:22Z", "role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks for uploading the strategy and data files. I've analyzed `yield_curve_momentum.py` and extracted the core details.\n\n**Pitch Summary:**\n- **Thesis:** Avoid equity drawdowns by exiting the market when the yield curve (10Y-2Y) inverts, combined with a 200-day trend filter.\n- **Tickers:** SPY\n- **Time Horizon:** Months (implied by 200-day lookback)\n- **Data Source:** FRED (T10Y2Y)\n\n**Action Required:**\nYour script is currently coded to **download data from FRED** via `requests`, but you also uploaded `T10Y2Y_spread.csv`.\n1. **Environment Restriction:** The evaluation environment may not have internet access. The script should likely be updated to read the local CSV file instead of fetching from the URL.\n2. **CSV Format:** I am validating your uploaded CSV to ensure it matches what the script would expect (dates, column names).\n\nI will validate the data file now. Please confirm if you want to proceed with the current script (web-fetch) or if you will provide an updated version that reads the local file."}
