The downloaded file matches the reference data - it's the T10Y2Y (10-year minus 2-year treasury spread) from FRED, just with slight formatting differences and the column renamed.\n\n**Download status: success**\n\n**Downloaded filename:** `T10Y2Y(9).csv`\n\n**Matching rationale versus the reference file:**\n- Source data: FRED T10Y2Y (10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity spread)\n- Same date range: 1976-06-01 to 2026-02-20\n- Same data values (minor formatting differences: trailing zeros like `0.70` vs `0.7`)\n- Column name difference: downloaded has `T10Y2Y`, reference has `spread_pct` (renamed)\n- Row count difference: downloaded has 12,975 rows (includes empty/missing value rows), reference has 12,426 rows (missing values excluded)\n- All non-missing data values match between the two files\n\n**GUI steps performed:**\n1. Inspected reference file via bash - identified columns `observation_date` and `spread_pct`, date range 1976-06-01 to 2026-02-20\n2. Opened Firefox by clicking the Firefox icon in taskbar\n3. Used Ctrl+L to focus address bar\n4. Typed the FRED URL: `https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=T10Y2Y`\n5. Pressed Enter - browser automatically downloaded the CSV file as `T10Y2Y(9).csv` (203 KB)\n6. Verified the downloaded file matches the reference data values",
