{"timestamp_utc": "2026-02-22T00:28:59Z", "role": "user", "content": "my strategy: Logic: Go long SPY only when both conditions are true simultaneously:\n\nSPY's price is above its 200-day SMA \u2014 confirms the market is in an uptrend\nThe 10Y-2Y Treasury spread (live from FRED) is above -0.10% \u2014 confirms the yield curve is not deeply inverted\nWhen either condition fails, move to cash.\n\nWhy it works: An inverted yield curve (short rates > long rates) historically precedes recessions by 6\u201318 months. By stepping out of equities when the curve inverts and the trend breaks, the strategy avoided the worst of 2008\u201309 and the 2022 rate-shock drawdown \u2014 cutting max drawdown from -55% (buy & hold) to -22%, while staying in the market ~70% of the time.\n\nKey numbers (2005\u20132026):\n\nCAGR: 6.97% vs 10.83% B&H \u2014 lower return, but much smoother ride\nMax drawdown: -21.5% vs -55.2%\nProfit factor: 3.81 (wins are 3.8x larger than losses in aggregate)\n108 total trades over 20 years \u2014 not overfit, very low turnover\nThe pitch thesis: macro regime filters (yield curve) + price trend filters compound to dramatically reduce tail risk, at the cost of some upside participation."}
