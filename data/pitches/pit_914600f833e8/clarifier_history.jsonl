{"timestamp_utc": "2026-02-22T08:17:01Z", "role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks for uploading the files. I've extracted the key details from `yield_curve_momentum.py`.\n\n**Pitch Confirmation Checklist:**\n- **Thesis:** Yield curve inversions (10Y < 2Y) historically precede recessions. Avoiding equities during inversions while using a 200-day trend filter reduces drawdowns and preserves upside.\n- **Tickers:** [\"SPY\"]\n- **Time Horizon:** Years (Strategic/Market Cycle)\n- **Data Source:** FRED (10Y-2Y Treasury Spread)\n- **Files:** Strategy (`yield_curve_momentum.py`), Data (`T10Y2Y_spread.csv`)\n\n**Observation:**\nYour script is currently set up to download data directly from FRED (`requests.get(FRED_URL)`). Since you uploaded `T10Y2Y_spread.csv`, do you want the strategy to rely on this local file instead? This ensures the backtest runs even if the environment has restricted internet access.\n\nI am validating your CSV file now. If the details above are correct, we are ready to proceed to the backtest."}
