It looks like you have a clear strategy in place.\n\n**Here is what I've extracted:**\n*   **Thesis:** Yield curve inversions (10Y < 2Y) precede recessions. You use this as a regime filter alongside a 200-day trend filter on SPY to reduce drawdown exposure.\n*   **Ticker:** SPY\n*   **Time Horizon:** Years (implied by the 200-day trend and recessionary cycles).\n*   **Data Source:** FRED (10Y-2Y spread).\n\n**One observation on implementation:**\nYour script `yield_curve_momentum.py` is currently coded to fetch data live from the FRED website (`requests.get`). However, you also uploaded `T10Y2Y_spread.csv`.\n*   **Risk:** Live fetching can fail during evaluation if the API changes or network access is restricted.\n*   **Recommendation:** It is better to modify your script to load the local `T10Y2Y_spread.csv` file if it exists. This ensures the evaluator sees the exact data you intended.\n\nI will proceed with validating your CSV and running a backtest on the current script to see how it performs."}
