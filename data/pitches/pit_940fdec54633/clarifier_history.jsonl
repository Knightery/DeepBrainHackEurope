I've extracted the key details from your `yield_curve_momentum.py` script:\n\n**Pitch Details Extracted:**\n*   **Thesis:** Avoid equity exposure (SPY) during yield curve inversions (10Y < 2Y) to reduce drawdowns, while using a 200-day SMA trend filter to capture upside during expansions.\n*   **Tickers:** [\"SPY\"]\n*   **Time Horizon:** Years (Macro regime strategies operate on long-term cycles).\n*   **Data Source:** FRED (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis).\n\n**Observation:**\nYour script is currently set up to download the yield curve data directly from FRED (`fetch_yield_curve`), but you also uploaded `T10Y2Y_spread.csv`. I will validate the uploaded CSV to ensure it's clean, and then run the backtest. If the script fails to download data in our environment, we may need to adjust it to read your uploaded CSV instead.\n\nI am now triggering the data validation and backtest."}
