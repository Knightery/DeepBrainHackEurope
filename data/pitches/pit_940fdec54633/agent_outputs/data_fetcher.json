Here is my final report:\n\n---\n\n**Download status: success**\n\n**Downloaded filename(s):** `T10Y2Y(10).csv` (203 KB, downloaded from `https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=T10Y2Y`)\n\n**Matching rationale versus the reference file:**\n- The reference file has columns `observation_date, spread_pct` with 12,426 data rows (1976-06-01 to 2026-02-20)\n- The downloaded file has columns `observation_date, T10Y2Y` with 12,974 total rows (of which 548 have missing/empty values)\n- After filtering out rows with missing values from the downloaded file: 12,974 - 548 = **12,426 rows** \u2014 an exact match\n- Data values match perfectly on all spot-checked dates (e.g., 2020-01-02: 0.30, 2019-08-14: 0.01, 2026-02-20: 0.60)\n- The reference file is the FRED T10Y2Y series with the column renamed from `T10Y2Y` to `spread_pct` and rows with missing values removed\n\n**Short trace of GUI steps:**\n1. Took screenshot to see desktop state\n2. Inspected reference file with bash (`head -20`) \u2014 confirmed columns `observation_date, spread_pct` starting 1976-06-01\n3. Clicked Firefox icon in taskbar to open browser\n4. Used `Ctrl+L` to focus address bar, typed the FRED CSV URL, pressed Enter\n5. Browser automatically downloaded `T10Y2Y(10).csv` (203 KB) \u2014 confirmed in download popup\n6. Compared downloaded file against reference using bash \u2014 confirmed exact match (12,426 non-null rows, identical values)",
