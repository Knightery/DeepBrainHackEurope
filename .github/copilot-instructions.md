# Copilot Instructions for this Repository

## Documentation maintenance rule (mandatory)

When changing product behavior, data contracts, required user inputs, commands, API shape, scoring logic, or onboarding flow:

1. Update the relevant docs in the same change.
2. Keep docs consistent with implementation.
3. At minimum, check and update as needed:
   - `readme.md` (high-level overview)
   - `MVP_SPEC.md` (detailed behavior and contracts)
   - `README_CHAINLIT.md` and/or `chainlit.md` for user-facing command/flow changes

Do not ship behavior changes without corresponding documentation updates.
